			<h3>What Video File Formats does DeVeDe Support?</h3>
			<p>DeVeDe uses Mplayer, Mencoder, FFMpeg, DVDAuthor, VCDImager and MKisofs to transform the videos, and as such can cope with almost any codec, so long as it is on your machine. Windows systems may be more fussy, but it will easily support AVI to DVD, MP4 to DVD, MPG to DVD, and MKV to DVD.</p>
			<p>This is by no means a full list of file formats.</p>

			<h3>What Disc Types does DeVeDe Support?</h3>
			<p class="important">If you have the disc, it's writable, and you have a disk drive that can burn it, DeVeDe will do it. DeVeDe doesn't actually carry out the burning itself isntead simply handling creating a disk image, than handing that work out. On Ubuntu, this usually means Brasero.</p>
			<p>CD-R, CD+R, CD-RW, CD+RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, or DVD+RW are common, with writable HD-DVDs never really catching on, but BluRay are gaining popularity.</p>
